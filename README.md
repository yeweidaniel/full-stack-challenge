# Full Stack Developer Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

###Design Architecture:

Top Level Containers (eg. AdminContainer) -> Dispatch Actions (Makes API Call) -> Reducer -> Top Level Containers -> Lower Level Presentations Components

* Containers: Connect Redux state to UI.  Delegate rendering to individual components, delegate API handling to action creators
* Components: Responsible specifically for rendering
* Action Creators: Communicate with API and/or dispatch actions
* Reducers: Handle dispatched actions by modifying application state

###Technology Used

* UI Rendering: React/Redux, React Router, React Logger
* Dependency Management: NPM

###UI Hierarchy

LoginComponent
* localhost:3000/login

AdminComponent
* localhost:3000/admin
* EmployeeInfoComponent
* PerformanceReviewComponent

EmployeeComponent 
* localhost:3000/employee/{id}
* PerformanceReviewComponent
