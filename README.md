# Full Stack Developer Challenge

###To Run
1. Run 'npm install'
2. Run 'npm start'
3. App Should be running now at localhost:3000
	* Admin Credentials: 1/secret

###Design Architecture:

The front end rendering uses React.js, while business logic/API interaction is handled by Redux. The architectural flow is as follows:

Top Level Containers -> Action Creators -> Reducer -> Top Level Containers -> Lower Level Presentations Components

* Top Level Containers: Connect Redux state to React UI.  Delegate rendering to individual components, delegate API handling to action creators
* Components: Responsible for rendering individual pages
* Action Creators: Communicate with API and/or dispatch actions
* Reducers: Handle dispatched actions by modifying application state

###Technology Used

* UI Rendering: React/Redux, React Router, React Logger, Webpack
* Dependency Management: npm

###UI Hierarchy
